0,1,1, 6.88m ,8,2,"In a monochrome flash-forward sequence, set after the events of Breaking Bad. a man named Gene works behind the counter at a shopping-mall Cinnabon in Omaha, Nebraska. Gene becomes tense when a customer seems to be staring at him, but is instantly relieved when he passes by him. Later, inside a modest house, Gene is flipping through channels when he decides to retrieve a VHS cassette from a hidden shoe box. The tapes contents is revealed to be a copy of TV advertisements from Genes former life as the flamboyant criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. As the ads play, ""Gene"" begins to weep. In May 2002, Jimmy McGill is a down-on-his-luck Albuquerque public defender representing three teenagers charged with breaking into a funeral home and performing a sex act on a severed human head. Jimmys argument to the jury is that the youths actions were simply ""boys being boys."" In response to this, the prosecutor — without saying a word — plays a video which contains footage of the teens offenses. Several members of the jury, the judge, and the court reporter are unable to look at the tape.  Jimmy drives to HHM to confront one of the firms named partners, Howard Hamlin. He drops the torn pieces of the check on the conference room table and accuses HHM of trying to cheat his brother Chuck — a founding partner of the firm — out of his rightful share. Assuring Howard that Chuck will probably not be returning to work, Jimmy demands that HHM give Chuck his $17 million severance package. Howard refuses to concede, stating Chuck is still on ""extended sabbatical."" Howard tries to pass along some documents for Chuck but Jimmy declines, insisting that he ""doesnt work here anymore."" Jimmy then notices the Kettlemans stopping in to hire HHM over him. Jimmy maintains enough composure to reach the parking garage before venting his frustration on a trash bin. Noticing an HHM attorney, Kim Wexler, standing nearby smoking a cigarette, Jimmy borrows a drag off it before pleading to her for help. Kim states she can do nothing. Jimmy visits Chuck, who believes himself to be suffering from electromagnetic hypersensitivity and requires visitors to leave personal electronic devices in the mailbox before entering his house. The power to Chucks house is shut off and he works by lantern light on a manual typewriter. Chuck insists he’s going to get better in order to HHM and declines Jimmy’s pleas to demand a payout from his partners, as the firm would probably have to liquidate to raise the necessary cash. Jimmy says his public defender work wont keep both of them afloat, but Chuck replies that the experience of helping people is more important than money. Chuck also reassures Jimmy that he does not have to provide for him, since Howard stopped by to deliver a check over $857, the first of a new weekly stipend. He also relates Howards concern about Jimmy using his name in his law practice, and suggests that he change it so as not to confuse potential clients. An infuriated Jimmy leaves. Desperate for money, Jimmy tracks down the Lindholm twins and proposes a partnership. He explains how, back when his hometown of Cicero, Illinois, he was known as ""Slippin Jimmy"" — reputed for finding slippery patches of ice every winter, stage a fall, and extort money from people. Jimmy enlists the twins in a plan to use a similar gambit on Betsy, staging a similar slip-and-fall scenario at a certain intersection on her daily commute. One of the twins will be hit by Betsys station wagon, after which Jimmy will come in, having just ""happened"" to be driving by, and offer his legal surfaces to her. Jimmy will purportedly talk the twins out of suing the woman, later paying both $2,000 for their troubles. In her gratitude, Betsy will then convince her husband to drop HHM and hire Jimmy for the embezzlement case. The twins execute the plan perfectly, but moments after the “accident” occurs, the car drives off to the dismay of the skateboarders. The twins give chase to the station wagon, skitching on the back of a truck. Jimmy sees this as an opportunity to gain more money at the prospect of defending a felony hit-and-run case. The car pulls into a driveway, where a Hispanic elderly woman exits the car. Despite knowing that she is not Betsy, the twins attempt to scam the woman anyway and follow her into her house. Jimmy frantically searches for the twins — they were briefly in cellphone contact — and happens across the parked wagon. He knocks on the front door, claiming to be an officer of the court. However, when the door opens, Jimmy comes face to face with Tuco Salamanca, who pulls Jimmy into the house at gunpoint."
1,1,2, 3.42m ,6,1,"Tuco is preparing salsa in his kitchen when his grandmother returns home, followed by Cal and Lars. The twins, irate, begin to insist on getting money for the injury caused by the grandmothers ""hit and run."" They begin to argue loudly and insult Tucos grandmother, which agitates him. After sending her upstairs, Tuco beats both twins unconscious with a cane. While Tuco is cleaning up bloodstains on his carpet, Jimmy knocks on the front door and is immediately taken hostage. Under interrogation, Jimmy reveals himself to be an attorney representing his two clients, who called him after the hit and run. He insists that he did not target Tucos grandmother. Noticing the bloodstains, Jimmy guesses that Tuco has only hurt the twins because Tuco is a ""reasonable"" and ""just"" man. Jimmy attempts to barter with Tuco to save himself and the twins. Tuco agrees with Jimmy, and brings him to the garage where they are being held. Just as Tuco is about free them, one of the twins immediately outs Jimmys role in the scam. Tuco takes Jimmy and the twins out into the desert. Under more questioning by Tuco, Jimmy finally cops to the entire ordeal - how he put the twins up to the scam as a way to get back at Craig and Betsy for not hiring him as their lawyer. When Tuco threatens to sever Jimmys fingers with wire cutters, he desperately tries to claim that he is an FBI agent. While Tuco initially believes this, his second-hand man, Nacho Varga, quickly sees through this façade and threatens Jimmy into telling the truth. Jimmy admits that he is a lawyer who intended to scam the Kettlemans, and how he was just trying to find a way to climb up from the pit that has become his life before Tuco ""rescued"" him. Tuco frees Jimmy and because he told the truth and the only reason the twins were there in the first place was because of him. Later that night, Jimmy goes to a bar with a woman to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Traumatized from witnessing Tuco maiming the twins, Jimmy is distracted by staff members breaking breadsticks, which is a familiar sound with legs breaking. Jimmy excuses himself and vomits in the bathroom. As a public defender, Jimmy defends client after client while earning $700 each time he does it. This degrades Jimmy, losing case after case when the prosecutor isnt willing to budge, but eventually gets a confidence boost when he finally wins an acquittal. "
2,1,3, 3.23m ,3,3,"Some time in the past, Chuck goes to a jail to visit Jimmy, who has been arrested for property damage, assault charges and a potential sex offense. Jimmy pleads for Chuck to make his charges disappear. Although originally reluctant, Chuck agrees to help after Jimmy states that his life is over if he cant get out of his situation. However, Chuck warns Jimmy not to make a fool of him if he gets back out. Jimmy vows to change and do anything for Chuck. In the present, Jimmy is anxious about Nachos plot to extort Betsy and Craig. He calls Kim, who is providing counsel to the Kettlemans for HHM. Jimmy indirectly warns Kim about the danger to the Kettlemans, but when she presses him on how thinks that, he brushes off the claim and claims it is just drunk speculation. After he hangs up, he stares at his phone before stating he is ""no hero."" Later that night, Jimmy calls the Kettlemans from a payphone and leaves an anonymous warning. Concerned, the Kettlemans look outside their house and see somebody in a parked van watching them.  The next morning, Jimmy learns from Kim that something has happened to the Kettlemans. After getting into another argument with Mike about parking validation, he rushes to the Kettlemans house to find it surrounded by police and the family gone missing. At the station, Jimmy tells Nacho that witnesses have placed him in the van parked outside the Kettleman house, and that blood was found in the van when the police searched it. Nacho maintains his innocence, saying that he watched the house but did not kidnap them. Nacho warns Jimmy that if he does not get his charges dropped, the police might uncover his connections to Tuco, which would result in Jimmys death. Jimmy tries to convince the police that Nacho is innocent, but they believe that he is covering for his client. Jimmy convinces Kim to take him to the house to examine the crime scene. Noticing inconsistent detail, such as a missing childs doll, Jimmy speculates that the Kettlemans staged their kidnapping so they could escape with their stolen money. He privately admits to Kim that he warned the Kettlemans about Nacho, which caused them to go into hiding. However, he has no way to prove his theory. The police ask Mike to press assault charges against Jimmy so that they can leverage him to testify against Nacho. Surprisingly, Mike takes Jimmys side and refuses to press charges, as he believes his theory about the Kettlemans disappearance is correct. Mike recounts a similar case he investigated as a Philadelphia police officer, where a suspect faked his disappearance: the authorities initially believed the suspect fled overseas, but he was really hiding near his own home. Mike tells Jimmy that  the Kettlemans are doing just that, hiding somewhere in the area, since it is human nature to stay near home. "
3,1,4, 2.87m ,10,3,"In a flashback, Jimmy (under the alias ""Saul Goodman"") and Stevie come across an unconscious man in an alleyway. Jimmy pokes the man with a stick and the man wakes up, flipping the two of them off and continuously taunting them. Frustrated with the mans rudeness, Stevie takes the money from his wallet and Jimmy steals his Rolex watch. Stevie offers a trade of the money in exchange for the more valuable Rolex and eventually offers him an additional $580 to bring the total to $1,580. It is later revealed that it was all a scam set up by Jimmy and the ""unconscious"" man, who is actually Jimmys longtime friend, Marco Pasternak. In the present, Craig and Betsy Kettleman plead with Jimmy not to expose them, offering $30,000 as a bribe that he initially refuses. Jimmy retorts with the option of them hiring him as their lawyer, which is in turn refused by the Kettlemans, who claim that he is ""the kind of lawyer guilty people would hire."" They refer back to the cash bribe. The next day, Jimmy purchases a new wardrobe from a local tailor, gets a makeover from Mrs. Nguyen at her beauty salon, and posts a billboard advertisement which shares obvious and deliberate similarities with HHM, presumably out of spite. When Kim confronts Jimmy and presents a cease-and-desist order at Howards behest, he at first playfully tries to shrug it off until he angrily admits that Howard ""fired the first shot"" by attempting to force Jimmy to cease using his name for business. Jimmy tells Kim that Howard is not appreciating her talent properly and that she deserves better. Kim warns Jimmy that Howard is preparing an injunction against him, and that this is a fight Jimmy will not be able to win.  In court, Jimmy and Howard argue in a judges chambers: Jimmy claims to be operating under ""fair use"", while Howard is firm in his assessment that Jimmy is clearly violating HHMs trademarks. The judge agrees with Howard and orders Jimmy to take down the billboard within 48 hours. However, Jimmy has been banking on this ruling and begins calling local news outlets in an attempt to cover his predicament as a human interest story.  As Jimmy visits Chuck, he brings him his newspapers as usual but hides the Albuquerque Journal, which bears a front-page story on Jimmys ""rescue"", to keep Chuck from seeing it. Chuck, still oblivious to Jimmys stunt, congratulates him on his success. Chuck notices the Journal is missing, which Jimmy dismisses. After he leaves, a suspicious Chuck painstakingly hurries to his neighbors house and collects their copy of the newspaper, leaving $5 as compensation. Back at home, Chuck reads about the story about Jimmy."
4,1,5, 2.71m ,5,0,"Two cops arrive at Chucks house after his neighbor, who witnessed Chuck stealing her newspaper, reported him. When Chuck refuses to open the door due to his electromagnetic hypersensitivity, one officer walks around the house to use the back door, finding that the breaker lines have been cut and that cans of oil on the floor. The two officers suspect that Chuck is a ""tweaker"". As Chuck lectures the officers about probable cause, they kick down the front door and taser him. Thanks to the billboard stunt, Jimmy gets a lot of potential business. He approaches an impressive ranch house to visit a prospective client, Big Ricky Sipes, who offers Jimmy $1 million in cash to help him ""personally secede"" from the U.S. Jimmys excitement at the windfall quickly dissipates when he realizes that the eccentric mogul wants to pay him in his own currency.  After Jimmy brings Chuck home and helps him to the couch, he catches sight of the Albuquerque Journal on the floor - still open to the article about the billboard stunt. He confronts Chuck, pointing out that his symptoms always seem to worsen when he thinks Jimmy has been up to no good. Chuck denies this, but Jimmy continues to plead his case: the billboard was just a bit of showmanship to get the ball rolling. Now hes ready to embrace the straight-and-narrow, even thinking of specializing in elder law. Chuck remains skeptical, but Jimmy vows sincerely that the stunt was a one-time thing. After another busy day at the courthouse, Jimmy pulls up to Mikes booth. For once, he has all the requisite parking stickers. He tells Mike cheerfully about his new venture into elder law and offers him a business card. As Jimmy drives off, Mike stays in his booth. Night dissolves into morning and Mike finishes his shift. After eating breakfast alone at Loyolas, he drives to a suburban neighborhood and parks across the street from a modest house. From inside his car, he watches as a woman exits the house, headed to work. As she drives by Mike, she slows and he makes no effort to conceal himself. The two lock eyes, but neither says a word. The woman drives off and so does Mike - in the opposite direction."
5,1,6, 2.57m ,3,0,"In a flashback, Mike arrives in Albuquerque by passenger train, travel-worn and carrying a lone duffel bag. He waits inside the station until his daughter-in-law, Stacey, picks him up. As she pulls the car around, he enters the empty ladies restroom to buy a maxi-pad from the coin-operated vending machine. Ducking into the men’s room, he unbuttons his shirt and reveals a fresh bullet wound beneath a blood-soaked bandage on his shoulder. Grimacing, he applies the pad to the wound, then buttons back up and leaves the station. At Stacey’s house, Mike pushes his young granddaughter Kaylee on a swing set. He takes a break to make small talk with Stacey, who seems to be keeping him at a distance. When she asks how long he’s planning to be in town, Mike tells her that hes going to stay indefinitely, to help out her and Kaylee. Stacey isnt thrilled by this news. Finally, she brings up what’s bothering her: she overheard Matt -- her husband and Mike’s son -- having a heated late-night phone conversation just a few days before his death. When she asks Mike if he was the one on the other end of the line, he denies remembering such a call and advises her not to dwell on it. Catching a taxi outside Stacey’s house, Mike finds a veterinarian, Dr. Caldera, who will stitch up his wound without asking too many questions. When the morally ambiguous vet offers to refer Mike for some “work,” he declines and says he’s not looking for that type of work. Jimmy arrives at the station with a cup of coffee, which Mike instructs him to spill on Abbasi after Mike answers his questions. Realizing that the stunt is a diversion that will allow Mike to steal the detective’s notepad, Jimmy refuses -- even after Mike reminds him that Jimmy owes him a favor for his help with finding the Kettlemans. When the detectives begin questioning Mike, Jimmy insists they start from the beginning and explain the events that brought them to New Mexico. Exasperated, Abbasi obliges: Mike was a cop in Philadelphia for nearly 30 years and his son Matt, a rookie, was killed in the line of duty nine months ago. Matt, along with his partner, Troy Hoffman, and his sergeant, Jack Fensky, were purportedly ambushed while responding to a shots-fired call in a bad neighborhood. Hoffman and Fensky escaped the attack, but were killed six months later in a similar ambush. Theorizing that Hoffman and Fensky were involved in corrupt activities that might have led to them -- and Matt -- getting killed, the detectives hope Mike can shed some light on what went down. Mike admits to seeing Hoffman and Fensky in a cop bar the night they were killed, but offers nothing more. He also says he wishes he could help the detectives, but he was drinking pretty heavily in those days and doesn’t remember anything else. Jimmy listens to Mike’s story quietly, gaining compassion for the man and his loss. After studying Abbasi’s notes about the case, Mike goes to Stacey’s house to confront her about calling the Philadelphia cops - he now knows shes the real reason why they’ve come to town. Upset, she explains that she made the call after discovering a large amount of mysterious cash hidden in the lining of a suitcase. Thinking Matt must have been involved in something criminal, she begs Mike to tell her the truth about her husband. Mike, livid at this suggestion, roars that Matt was ""not dirty"" before storming out of the house. When the bar closes, Mike is the last patron to leave. As he stumbles home, Fensky and Hoffman roll by in their cruiser and offer to give him a ride. When he declines, they insist, ushering Mike into the back of the cruiser and relieving him of his gun. Jovially, Fensky presses Mike about what he said to them earlier in the night. Still seemingly intoxicated, Mike declares in no uncertain terms what he meant: he’s sure that Hoffman and Fensky were responsible for his son’s murder and hes going to prove it. The cops trade glances."
6,1,7, 2.67m ,4,4,"Late at night, Jimmy and Mike wait for the Philadelphia detectives at the police station. When Abbasi and Sanders arrive, Jimmy returns the younger detective’s notebook, claiming that he found it on the ground in the parking lot. Irate, Abbasi confronts Mike about stealing it, asking if there is anything he’d like to say about the notebooks contents. The detectives tell Mike they’re interviewing with Stacey the next day. Abbasi storms out of the station, but Sanders lingers behind. In private, Sanders apologizes for Abbasi’s behavior, but Mike waves it off – the young detective was just doing his job. Mike concedes that he doesn’t know what Stacey will tell them; whatever she chooses to say is entirely her decision, and she’s earned the right to decide for herself.  In HHMs conference room, Kim meets with Betsy and Craig Kettleman. She advises them not to take their case to trial, because their chances of winning are very low. She urges the couple to take the plea deal she’s negotiated on their behalf, which would reduce Craig’s sentence from thirty years to only sixteen months. The Kettlemans refuse and fire Kim on the spot. Jimmy stops by HHM to collect the Kettleman case files and learns that Howard has demoted Kim to an office in a distant part of the building - loosely known the ""Cornfield"" in the firm - as punishment for losing the Kettlemans. Feeling guilty, he finds her in the parking garage and apologizes. She shrugs, knowing he did what he could. Kim warns Jimmy that Craig didn’t cover his tracks well and refuses to play the one chip he has: the missing money. It’s a loser case. "
7,1,8, 2.87m ,2,0,"In a flashback, a jubilant Jimmy pushes a mail cart at HHM. His smile fades as he reaches Kims office and holds up an envelope. He tells her that he cant open it, since hes too nervous about its contents. Kim takes the envelope and reads the letter, then kisses Jimmy. In Chucks office, Jimmy reveals that he has passed the state bar exam, having taken online courses and applying to the University of American Samoa. Jimmy asks if he can come work at HHM once he is sworn in. Chuck tells him that he has to confer with the other partners, but signals optimism. Later that day, Jimmy celebrates with Kim and his co-workers in the mail room. Howard stops by the party and - after the others have left - informs Jimmy that HHM will not be hiring him. In the present, Kim unpacks in her old office. After salvaging the Kettleman case, she is back in the good graces of HHM and has been allowed to return from exile in the dreaded ""Cornfield."" Howard convinces her to attend the firms press conference on the settlement of the Kettleman case. She agrees and stands demurely in the background as Howard makes the announcement.  At work, Mike recieves a call from Stacey, who has accepted the situation and forgiven him for his involvement in Matts death. She asks if he could watch Kaylee later on while she is at work, to which Mike readily agrees. There will be no impositions for her; anything she needs, Mike will provide.  Schweikart receives a fax that includes a new, proper demand letter from Jimmy and Chuck, along with copies of reassembled Sandpiper billing statements. Schweikart and his team arrive at Chucks house to negotiate with the McGill brothers. Jimmy meets them at the curb, curtly asks them to leave their electronics in the car, escorts them inside, and seats them at Chucks dining room table. He then ducks into the kitchen to get Chuck, whom he finds disheveled and in a state of anxiety. Jimmy reassures Chuck, helping him into his jacket as he restores Chucks confidence and leads him into the dining room where"
8,1,9, 2.38m ,1,2,"A short while after Chuck surprised both Jimmy and himself by leaving his house without wearing a space blanket, the brothers sit quietly on a nearby park bench. Chuck tries to relax and enjoy the sunshine, but keeps glancing nervously at the power lines overhead. Jimmy redirects his attention to the soft grass, successfully encouraging Chuck to take off his shoes. Finally reaching his limit, Chuck tells Jimmy that hes ready to go inside and get back to work building their case against Sandpiper Crossing. He rises and walks gingerly back toward his house, buoyant Jimmy at his side.   Kim visits Howard in his office, demanding to know why he refused to hire Jimmy. Howard coldly reminds her that shes talking out of turn and that this was a decision made by the partners. Shaken, Kim turns and begins to head out. Howard reconsiders and stops her. Not wanting the rest of the firm to hear what hes about to tell her, he instructs her to close the door. That night, Kim visits Jimmy at the nail salon and urges him to take Howards deal. Livid, Jimmy accuses her of being bought off by Howard. Near tears, she reiterates that taking the deal is the best thing for Jimmy but leaves without going into more detail. Bothered by their exchange, Jimmy retreats to his office and finally plugs his dead cell phone into the wall. As it begins to recharge, Jimmy ruminates - something about Kims insistence has gotten under his skin."
9,1,10, 2.53m ,13,0,"In a flashback to 1992 in Cicero, Illinois, shortly after Chuck has helped secure his release from jail, Jimmy stops by a local bar to say farewell to Marco, his best friend and partner in crime. He tells Marco that he’s moving to Albuquerque to work in the mailroom at Chuck’s law firm. Marco bemoans Jimmy’s decision, arguing that the move is a waste of Slippin’ Jimmy’s talents – but Jimmy’s mind is made up, and he leaves.   Off this high, the pair spend the next several days gleefully pulling one scam after another. After a week-long binge, Jimmy wakes in Marco’s apartment to a disappointed waitress who was under the impression that she had gone home the night before with Kevin Costner. As he gets dressed, his cell phone falls out of his pocket, prompting Jimmy to check his voicemail and find he has numerous messages from current and potential clients inquiring about his elder law services. Jimmy finally tells Marco that he’s a lawyer and it’s time for him to go back to Albuquerque. Marco is amazed that Slippin’ Jimmy is a lawyer - it’s the ultimate way to scam folks out of their money. Jimmy explains that he’s not ripping anybody off: he’s building a legitimate practice with clients who depend on him. Marco is unable to talk Jimmy into staying in Chicago for the long-term, but he reveals that he still has the last Rolex watch from their infamous scam and convinces Jimmy to pull one last con with him. Outside Marco’s funeral, Jimmy possesses Marcos pinkie ring, which was given to him by his mother. Jimmy takes a call from Kim, who informs him that the ballooning size of the Sandpiper case has led HHM to team up with another firm, Davis & Main. She tells him the partners at Davis & Main know all about Jimmy, and are willing to offer him a partner-track position - contingent upon a meeting with him later that week. Knowing that she must have pulled some strings to make this happen, an appreciative Jimmy thanks Kim."
10,2,1, 2.57m ,9,0,"In the present day, ""Gene"" heads to the mall dumpster to take out the trash. The door closes behind him, locking him in the room with the dumpster. An emergency exit is available to Gene, but a note indicates the police would be contacted immediately if its opened. Instead of using that option, he waits 2 ½ hours until a member of the night cleaning crew opens the door for him. While waiting for help, Gene carves a little message into the wall with a loose screw that reads ""SG was here.""    Floating again in the hotel pool, Jimmy spots an easy mark too tempting to pass up. He leaves a voicemail for Kim, beckoning her to take another spin as his partner-in-crime. Left alone, Jimmy seems to lose some of his buoyancy. After a pensive beat, he makes another call to Davis & Main."
11,2,2, 2.23m ,8,0,"At his house, Chuck plays his piano when Howard arrives with a grocery delivery. Howard delicately informs Chuck that Jimmy was hired by Davis & Main in a partner-track position to maintain continuity on the Sandpiper Crossing case. Taken aback, Chuck asks whether Cliff is aware of Jimmy’s background. Howard says he painted a full, honest picture of Jimmy - but also admits that he didn’t stand in the way of Jimmy being hired. As Howard departs, Chuck sits scowling in silence.  In his cozy office at Davis & Main, Jimmy pores over Sandpiper documents. He hears guitar music emanating from Cliff’s office, so Jimmy pops his head in to share a discovery he’s made. Cliff tells Jimmy he plays to “blow off steam,” and then commends Jimmy on his hard work. When Ernesto drops off groceries at Chucks house, he finds Chuck putting on his space blanket-lined jacket, ready to venture out. Meanwhile, at the abandoned power plant, Daniel hands Nacho the keys to his Hummer in exchange for the stolen baseball cards. Daniel is devastated to discover that Nacho plans to send his car directly to a chop shop, but is relieved to find his card collection in good order. Nacho hands $10,000 to Mike, unceremoniously concluding his business arrangement with Daniel. Wallowing in his defeat, Daniel looks to Mike for sympathy but doesn’t find any. As they prepare to head back to Albuquerque, Daniel gets a call from the police. "
12,2,3, 2.20m ,5,0,"In Amarillo, Texas, Jimmy leans against the wall of a run-down building as a bus full of Sandpiper Crossing residents slows to a stop in front of him. The driver, who has been bribed by Jimmy to stop here, hops out, apologizing to his passengers for a ""hiccup."" Jimmy steps aboard, searching for a Mrs. Alma May Urbano and asking if she received a Davis & Main class action mailer concerning Sandpipers overcharging. Other passengers overhear their conversation and pepper Jimmy with questions. Jimmy explains that Sandpiper may have overcharged them, too, and offers to help get their money back. Shortly thereafter, the seniors file off the bus at their restaurant destination, handing a pleased Jimmy their signed letters of engagement.  At Davis & Main, Jimmy and Omar review response rates for their class action mailers. Out of the 283 mailers sent to the Sandpiper branch in Colorado Springs, Jimmy is irked to discover that they received zero responses. In the lobby, Jimmy catches Cliff as he heads out for a business trip. Jimmy takes the opportunity to quickly update him on the case, speculating that Sandpiper staff members in Colorado Springs are throwing their mailers away before residents can see them. He pitches an alternative way to reach clients: a highly targeted television commercial. Cliff acknowledges that the firm produced a commercial for a previous class action lawsuit, so hed be open to discussing the idea. Back in his office, Jimmy appraises Davis & Main’s previous foray into the world of legal advertising. Their lackluster commercial leaves him underwhelmed.  Jimmy paces anxiously in his office as his commercial is about to hit the airwaves. He confirms with Omar that all calls will be correctly routed and answered. Reassured but still nervous, he retreats back into his office and tries his old “magic fingers” ritual to summon calls. Just as he’s about ready to admit defeat, the phones begin to ring. Jimmy heads out into the bullpen, where all of the assistants are taking calls. Jimmy takes in the bustling bullpen with pride. Meanwhile, Stacey and her daughter sleep soundly in Kaylee’s tiny bed. Having finally convinced Stacey to let him stay over, Mike lies awake on her couch. His phone vibrates; Caldera offers him a “next-level” job from a guy specifically requesting Mike."
13,2,4, 2.20m ,4,0,"Late in the evening, Mike enters his house. Pained, he tosses a stack of hundred dollar bills onto the kitchen table. He stiffly makes his way to the kitchen, pulling a bag of frozen vegetables out of the freezer and pressing it to his face. As he slumps into a chair, he lowers the bag: his eye is badly swollen shut and his face has been violently beaten. Mike reaches into his pocket and pulls out a silver necklace shaped like a pair of boxing gloves.    The next day, Nacho and Tuco (wearing the silver boxing glove necklace) sit across a table at the restaurant from one of their dealers, Krazy-8, and counts his cash. As Nacho counts the money again, Tuco stares at Krazy-8 for an uncomfortably long time, but Nacho allows Krazy-8 to leave. As he does, Tuco snorts a hit of crystal meth. Once Krazy-8 drives off in a Tampico Furniture van, Mike uses a payphone to call the police, anonymously reporting that a man is threatening another man with a gun at the restaurant. Mike then gets into his car, drives across the street and pulls into restaurant parking lot, deliberately scraping Tuco’s car. Tuco sees the collision and seethes as Mike walks in and orders food to go at the counter. Tuco angrily confronts Mike, who shrugs him off and deliberately flashes a wallet full of hundred-dollar bills as he collects his food."

He puts on music, then makes his way to the kitchen to help his wife, Rebecca, prepare dinner. Chuck apologizes in advance for the guest they’re expecting: Jimmy, whom he describes as “an acquired taste.” Rebecca isn’t worried, but they come up with a plan in which she will tug on her earlobe if she tires of Jimmy and wants to end dinner early. Jimmy arrives early, six-pack in hand, and is impressed by Chucks house. Chuck impatiently invites him inside.  The next morning, Jimmy arrives at Davis & Main to find Erin already waiting in his office. Jimmy apologizes for ditching her and launches into an elaborate excuse. Erin sees through it and cuts him off. Jimmy drops the act and agrees to look at her notes. Meanwhile, inside a stairwell at HHM, Kim spends her lunch break making calls, trying to drum up new business and get back on Howard’s good side. As charming as she is, she strikes out on every lead. Deflated, she returns to doc review to keep working. Kim continues to search for a new client for HHM. At last, she receives a return call from Paige Novick, who works as senior counsel for Mesa Verde Bank & Trust. Kim jumps for joy after arranging a meeting over the phone, her cheer reverberating in the empty parking garage. The next day, Kim and Howard greet Paige and Kevin Wachtell, the CEO of Mesa Verde, in the lobby of HHM. After a successful meeting, Kim offers to draw up a list of associates to assign to the case. Howard informs her that someone else will spearhead that - Kim has enough on her plate in doc review. He heads back inside, leaving Kim disheartened and disillusioned. Howard visits Chuck to share the good news about Mesa Verde. Chuck is impressed that Kim has snagged $250,000 in billings and possibly years of work for HHM, but Howard indicates that he hasnt forgiven her yet. Later, before sunrise, Chuck heads into HHM and works by lantern. He’s interrupted by Kim, who is dropping off paperwork.

15,2,6, 2.11m ,12,0,"Jimmy lies awake in the bed of his corporate apartment in the middle of the night. He tosses and turns, but simply cant get comfortable. Giving up on falling asleep, he turns on the TV and starts channel surfing, finding that Davis & Main have used a very plain version of a class action lawsuit ad, with the white text over swirly nebulousness that he hated from the previous one. Jimmy decides to blow off steam by throwing around the straw decorative balls around his apartment in manners imitating games like basketball and bowling. After he gets bored, he drives to the nail salon and goes to the back room of the nail salon, where he finally falls asleep in his old office. The next morning, as Kim is getting ready to for work, she gets a call from Jimmy, but decides to let it go to voicemail.

Jimmy is still in the nail salon back office, when Mrs. Nguyen comes in, annoyed at Jimmys presence. However Jimmy says he is in his right to be there as a rent-paying tenant. She speculates that he has already lost his job, to which Jimmy agrees he doesnt really want it.   The next day, Kim is at work in her office when Howards secretary comes by with some Sandpiper documents for her to review.

16,2,7, 2.03m ,5,0,"In 1973, a young Jimmy is ""working"" at his fathers store, secretly reading a Playboy magazine. A customer comes in and asks Jimmys father for loose change and medicine, since hes got a sick kid. Jimmy immediately deduces that the customer is actually a con man looking to steal money from the till. He tries to tell his father, but he refuses to listen to Jimmy. When Charles Sr. goes to the back to get the item the customer is looking for, Jimmy approaches the cash register to handle the man. After receiving his money, the con man tells Jimmy that there are ""wolves and sheep in this world"" and that he must figure out which hes going to be. He then leaves the store. As Jimmys father returns with parts to help fix the con mans ""broken down"" car, Jimmy, watching him follow the customer outside, quietly begins stealing money from the register. In 2002, Jimmy sits on a bench in the courthouse lobby, doodling out something on a notepad. Moments later, Mike shows up. Jimmy replaces his conservative legal wear with several suits of ugly, garish colors. He shows up the next day dressed in his new wear, introducing himself to everyone he can. He brings in a loud, bulky blender to the break room and proceeds to spray the entire room with ingredients while attempting to make a smoothie. He advises the custodian (from Michigan) on cleaning techniques in a Mexican accent, much to the custodians annoyance. He fails to flush the toilets on a constant basis, and details a list of conservation concerns when Cliff relays a group complaint.  In her office, Kim writes an email to Howard. Jimmy visits her, unbeknownst to Howard, and asks to talk in the conference room. He offers to make Kim her partner under the name ""Wexler McGill"" where she can be her own boss. Kim worries about the big all-or-nothing gamble at stake, but Jimmy reassures her that the odds are in her favor because she is an amazing lawyer and that she deserves more than just a lateral move which Howard and Schweikart represent. Annoyed at the one-sided conversation, Kim asks Jimmy about his position with Davis & Main and learns that he quit. Jimmy says that he did not fit at the firm, contrary to how he feels about working with Kim, who is concerned whether he will play it straight as her partner. Jimmy knows the answer she is hoping to hear, but after looking at Marcos ring, admits he must be himself due to the negative consequences he and others faced when he tried to imitate their ways. Kim is still perplexed as to why Jimmy needs her, but he corrects her by saying that he wants her. She states that he already has her, just not as a law partner.  Kim interviews at Schweikart and Cokely. After a lengthy conversation about her law experience, Schweikart wants to change the subject and hear her backstory. She tells him she grew up in a small town near the Kansas-Nebraska border where she had limited prospects. However, she wanted ""something more"", which led her to pursue law at UNM. After the interview, Schweikart tells Kim that she should expect to hear from them by tomorrow. Both excited and nervous about the offer, Kim accidentally calls him ""Howard"" when shaking his hand good-bye. Later, while smoking a cigarette on the parking garage, Kim looks at Jimmys Wexler McGill business card and has an idea after she rips it in half, separating the W and M in the logo."

Jimmy advises her to send a letter of resignation to HHM that night to officially give notice and not break her contract when she calls Mesa Verde and her other clients the next morning to bring them along to her new firm. Kim replies that she needs to do things in a way that are right for her.  Jimmy and his film crew, accompanied by a wheelchair-bound elderly man called Fudge, arrive at a military base and view a B-29 bomber named FIFI with Captain Bauer, who is under the impression that Fudge is a war hero; in truth, Fudge is merely a client Jimmy once defended for public masturbation. Bauer expresses his admiration for Fudge and asks many detailed questions about his service. To not let him get exposed, Jimmy asks Bauer to get some water for Fudge, to which he happily obliges. As Bauer is away, Jimmy and his crew begin filming another bit for Jimmys commercial with Fudge standing in front of FIFI. They finish the scene just in time for Bauer to return with a group of soldiers, who wish to take a photo with Fudge. Jimmy reluctantly agrees. "

At his office, Jimmy receives a dire phone call from Howard regarding Chuck, prompting him to go see him. To Jimmys shock and worry, Chuck has lined the walls and ceilings of his living room with metal sheets, claiming that the walls and ceilings did nothing to reflect the electromagnetic rays that led to the deterioration of his mind over time, believing this is what caused him to make the typo in the Mesa Verde documents.

Gene reluctantly tips off pursuing police officers to the shoplifters location, resulting in an arrest. However, as the shoplifter is led away, Gene is overcome with emotion and shouts at him to say nothing and hire a lawyer. When he returns to work, Gene faints.  After finding the mysterious message on his windshield in the desert, Mike understands that his hit on Hector has been completely compromised and Mike himself is most likely in danger. He drives at break-neck speeds to flee the reserve in his station wagon. His first intuition is that someone has placed a tracking device on his vehicle. Not easily able to spot it, he stops in a junkyard and begins to meticulously disassemble the vehicle. After hours of unsuccessful searching, and with the junkyard about to close, Mike has an epiphany: he takes apart the wagons gas cap and finds a tracking device inside. At home, he finds and examines another device hidden in his Chrysler sedan, recording its ID number.  At a railway warehouse, Mike meets up with Caldera, who is upset about being called in the middle of the night. Mike requests a tracking device and monitor identical to the one used to bug his vehicle. Caldera agrees, but warns Mike he will need time and extra money for this job. He also admonishes Mike to keep to ""business hours"" when contacting him. During a visit to Chucks house, Ernesto brings new batteries for Chucks tape recorder. Feigning not to be able to change the batteries due to his EHS condition, he asks Ernesto to do so. When he finishes changing the batteries, the recorder plays back a small section of Jimmys confession -- it seems that the play button had accidentally been left on. The passage is sufficiently explicit for Ernesto to grasp the gravity of what he has just heard. Chuck pressures Ernesto to never tell anyone else on the pretext of confidentiality. Stunned, Ernesto hurriedly finishes his tasks and leaves. Chuck seems pleased to have managed what appears to be the first step in his gambit against Jimmy."

When the car -- revealed to be driven by Victor -- drives off, the readout indicates the tracker is inside. Mike follows the Escalade. Kim conducts research and, based on what she has learned, figures that Chuck cannot use the confession tape in court and will not use it to win back Mesa Verde and reveals she has strategies ready to get the tape exuded outright in court (almost exactly as Howard predicted in the previous episode). Kim suggests that Jimmy not act and wait for Chuck to make the first move. Instead, Jimmy angrily leaves. "

Soon afterwards, Juan Bolsa arrives and presents Don Eladio with a Los Pollos Hermanos T-shirt as well as the returns from Gus operation -- a much larger amount, neatly packed in plastic wrapping.

Jimmy further confronts Chuck about how close he has to be to an electrical object to be affected by his EHS. He asks Chuck to identify the closest source of electricity and reveals that he has his cell phone in his pocket, but Chuck -- calling his bluff -- points out that Jimmy had removed the battery. However, his condescension over Jimmys ""sorry little trick"" is cut short, when Jimmy asks Chuck to remove an object from his breast pocket, which proves to be the fully charged battery; Jimmy had Huell plant it on Chuck during their encounter in the stairwell, and although Chuck has been carrying it for an hour and 43 minutes, he has not been affected at all."

He then drives out-of-state, listening to the police radio frequency through a CB scanner throughout the journey. Gene has breakfast at a diner, but has trouble interacting with a server when he is taken aback by a story in the newspaper. Outside the diner, he phones the Cinnabon to take a few days off work. Gene drives back home and spends that time listening to the scanner and peering outside. In 2004, shortly after the reinstatement of his law license, Jimmy is signing the DBA allowing him to practice under his new name. Outside the licensing room, Jimmy explains to an anxious Kim that, rather than practice law nobly as he misled the bar committee into believing, he plans to take the criminals who know him from his illicit drop phone business and use them as his new client base. Kim, upset by this turn of events, reluctantly agrees to accept Jimmys new plan. Jimmy returns to the licensing office to sign the final piece of paperwork as ""Jimmy Saul Goodman McGill"".  Outside the chicken farm, Bolsa confronts Lalo for spying on Guss operation and murdering the TravelWire employee. Lalo replies that he is simply looking after the interests of his uncle Hector, who believes that Gus is holding a grudge against the cartel after Hector executed his ""boyfriend."" Bolsa insists that Gus is solely concerned with business, to which Lalo expresses skepticism due to an unspecified past incident in Santiago. Bolsa says that Gus will never be ""one of us"" but that hes a good earner who keeps Eladio happy, which is all that matters. Lalo tells Bolsa that he has no further issues with Gus.  "

In the morning they wake up after passing out behind the wheel of the car, which has crashed into the lawn of a suburban house. The two remark that ""Its Tuesday.., which means 50% off!"" and they race off in their car as the bumper is rapidly falling off, feeling confident that Jimmy will get them out of trouble in case the law catches up to them. The camera pans out to reveal a garden gnome the two had stolen broken on the pavement.  Nacho is asleep with Jo in bed next to him. All of a sudden, some men led by Tyrus burst into his house, and before he can grab his gun or escape, they pin him down and bring him into a car. They head to a restaurant where Nachos father is, where he watches as Gustavo Fring and Victor threaten him. Gus gets into the car and tells Nacho that Lalo Salamanca is a problem and that he will have to find a way to earn his trust and sabotage the operation from the inside. Lalo visits his uncle Hector Salamanca at Casa Tranquila and discusses Gus mysterious new construction project. Lalo doesnt buy Gus cover story about building a new chicken refrigeration facility, and expresses disapproval that Don Juan Bolsa and Don Eladio Vuente seem to believe Gus. An elder care worker reminds Lalo to keep Hector hydrated and hands him a ""very berry"" flavored drink. He then adds liquor from a hip flask into the drink and serves it to Hector. Lalo tastes the drink but just dumps it out and serves straight liquor to Hector. The same two tweakers from the teaser come back to the Fifth Street Apartment looking for more cocaine, this time ordering ten bags rather than their usual two. Mouse sends the ten bags down the rain gutter, but they appear to be stuck. The skells and Mouse yell back and forth, demanding they get their product since they already paid Arlo. Jimmy uses his newfound energy to finesse and sweet talk his way through the Bernalillo County Courthouse. He prepares for a monologue to give before ADA Suzanne Ericsen, but instead he encounters ADA Bill Oakley, who is unimpressed by the film crews ""candid camera""-like stunt the last time they met and refuses to budge on a sentencing deal for one of Jimmys clients. In a long shot scene, he speaks to a clerk and some clients before running to Oakley again, who has just exited the courtroom and is flabbergasted that Jimmys client had witnesses. Oakley then agrees to commute the sentence. Jimmy encounters Howard Hamlin, who congratulates him on getting his law license reinstated. Howard invites him to have lunch, only to be interrupted when Jimmy spots Ericsen leaving a courtroom and follows her down the hall. Ericson gives an instant retort to ""we have a lot in common"" with ""I hope we dont"" and refuses to discuss any of his 15 cases she is prosecuting, telling him hes just trying to make as much money as possible by taking on too many clients, before stepping into an elevator.

Meanwhile, Nacho and Blingy drive Jimmy to a garage where Lalo is repairing his car. Lalo warmly greets a fearful Jimmy and states that he is impressed with how Jimmy used his communication skills to talk Tuco out of killing the skateboarders a few years previously. Lalo tells Jimmy that he wants him to carry a message to Krazy-8 inside the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is protected under attorney-client privilege. Jimmy tries to talk himself out of the imposed job by mentioning increased rates, but Lalo hands him over the demanded fee in cash on the spot. Jimmy returns to Kims apartment and finds Kim waiting for him on their balcony. Kim is in a celebratory mood, as her schedule the following day is packed with her pro bono cases instead of work for Mesa Verde. When Kim asks how Jimmys day went, Jimmy evasively answers that he met ""some interesting people"" and had a few ""ups and downs"" but insists that he had his best day yet in terms of income. Kim appears to aware that Jimmy is not telling her the whole truth but doesnt confront him.  As Jimmy sits across the street from the MDC, an unmarked police car arrives carrying DEA agents Hank Schrader and Steven Gomez. As they enter the jail and leave their weapons in a holding room, Hank and Gomez engage in conversation about expired food. They walk into the interview room and meet with Krazy-8, who has expressed a willingness to talk. Following Jimmy and Lalos script, Krazy-8 gives the agents details about drug dealing procedures and where hidden drug money can be found. Playing his part in the charade, Jimmy loudly enters the room and pretends to have a disagreement with his client about sharing information with the police. Hank immediately sees through Jimmys ""Saul Goodman"" persona, and he and Gomez are suspicious of the overblown performance. When the agents attempt to leave the room, Jimmy tells them that Krazy-8s information will lead to results; Hank insists that it has to lead to further arrests. Jimmy demands protection for his client as a confidential informant. Agreeing on that, Krazy-8 continues by sharing the exact locations of three dead drops.  Kim arrives in Tucumcari and meets Paige on a barren plot of land which used to be a residential neighborhood, where only one house remains standing. The homeowner, Everett Acker, is stubbornly refusing to sell his piece of the land, on which Mesa Verde plans to build a call center. Meeting with Acker outside his house, Kim pragmatically outlines the situation -- that Acker merely took out a lease on the land, but did not purchase it -- but also tries to empathize with his point of view. She informs Acker that Mesa Verde has raised the contractually agreed sum for buying him out. Acker flatly refuses the new offer, dismissing her overtures as merely a tactical move by Mesa Verde and insisting that no one will ever get him to abandon his property. When Acker calls out Kim on moral grounds, she angrily takes Mesa Verdes offer off the table and tells him to stick to the law like his former neighbors, who sold their homes. Even though Paige thinks Kim has brought the dispute to an end, Kim isnt pleased with the situation.  At dusk, Kim is driving back from Tucumcari while being updated on her pro bono cases by Stef via phone. Uneasy with her encounter with Acker, she decides to turn around and drive back to Tucumcari, reaching Ackers house after dark. Using a plank of wood to gain access to Ackers property, Kim persuades him to speak with her again. Kim tells Acker that she has visited a real estate office and has found some houses in his price range that he might like, even offering to help him move out of her own pocket. Kim is forced to admit that she doesnt know how Acker feels since she has never been a homeowner herself. She further tells him about her childhood, during which her mother often couldnt pay rent and forced the family to move from one place to another. Acker accuses Kim of making up her story in order to cajole him into selling his land and goes back into his house."

Whilst exiting Kims apartment, they walk past the shattered bottles they threw over the balcony. Jimmy tells Kim that he has decided to finally take up Howard on his offer of lunch; Kim wants to spend the day ""fixing"" the day before. After Jimmy drives away, Kim sweeps up glass shards on the tarmac and calls in to one of the associates at Schweikart and Cokely, beginning to devise a plan to resolve the land dispute in Tucumcari involving Everett Acker. At Schweikart and Cokely, Kim attends a meeting with Paige and Kevin concerning the Tucumcari call center, and suggests that Mesa Verde move construction to another lot and allow Acker to continue living in his house. Paige expresses doubts, but Kim rebuts her with a PowerPoint presentation that she composed ahead of the meeting, trying to convince them that conditions at the alternative lot have become more favorable than Ackers land. Although Kim argues the ""reputational risk"" to Mesa Verde of forcing Acker off his property, Kevin and Paige insist that the bank is lawfully entitled to the land. Paige tells Kevin that Acker will be out of his house and construction proceeding by the following Friday. Kim is disillusioned by the decision. As Los Pollos Hermanos is closing for the night, a tense Gus waits by the phone to hear whether the plans concerning the dead drops have gone to plan. Gus vents his frustration by making Lyle clean the fryer twice, with neither job being to Gus dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, Hank and Gomez lay in wait for the final dead drop and engage in humorous conservation about the origins of the word ""culvert"". A suspect finally approaches the drop and collects the money before attempting a getaway in his car. Hank drives through the culvert in an attempt to intercept the suspect. Hanks plan seems to have worked, but the suspect suddenly -- leaving the drug money in the car -- runs away on foot. The DEA agents continue to search the area to no avail. The suspect, one of Gus subordinates, is escorted out of the area in an SUV by Victor. Gomez counts $700,000 from the drop, but Hank is dissatisfied with the fact that the big shot dealers are still out there. Gomez reminds him that three suspects are still in custody and Krazy-8 is back on the streets as an informant. Despite his misgivings, Hank cheerfully addresses the DEA and APD officers who helped with the stake-out, inviting them to a bar to celebrate. After receiving a phone call from Victor that everything went according to plan, Gus finally allows Lyle go home. In Tucumcari, Jimmy lets himself onto Ackers property and greets him at his front door, using a picture of ""a man fucking a horse"" -- with the man representing Jimmy and the horse representing Mersa Verde -- to persuade him to let Jimmy act as his lawyer. As he leaves the property, Jimmy calls a thankful Kim to acknowledge the development. That night, Jimmy drives his Suzuki Esteem to Howards house. Donning gloves, Jimmy throws the bowling balls he purchased over Howards gate. Two out of three successfully hit Howards Jaguar, denting the hood and smashing the back windshield.

Kim tries to withdraw from the case, citing the conflict of interest of having Jimmy, her boyfriend, being Ackers counsel. Kevin suspects that Acker hired Jimmy precisely to have her removed from the case, and insists that Kim remain involved with the case and press ahead with building the Tucumcari call center.  At Kims apartment, Jimmy is cooking curry in the kitchen when Howard phones him, asking if he has considered his offer of a job at HHM. Jimmy falsely tells Howard that he is mulling it over, and hangs up on Howard before he can give him more details about the job. After doing so, Jimmy strikes and breaks a ceramic object in a duffel bag with a hammer. Kim comes home and informs Jimmy that Kevin has refused to remove her from the Acker case. Jimmy asks Kim to recount her discussion with Kevin in detail, urging her to make a mocking imitation of his sitting posture and drawling accent. Roleplaying the impromptu skit causes Jimmy and Kim to decide to take a shower together.  That night, Kim and Jimmy laying in bed and discuss the Acker case. Despite Jimmys assurances that she did the best she could do for Acker, Kim has resigned herself to his impending eviction. Despite telling Kim that the pragmatic thing to do is to take the loss and move on, Jimmy entices her with the idea that there is still ""another play"" to help Acker: ""going after"" Kevin and forcing him a compromise. Jimmy makes a phone call to Mike, who is still convalescing at the compound in Mexico, and offers him a paying job performing ""oppo research""; Mike flatly refuses. After ending the call, Mike helps Senora Cortazar prevent water from leaking through a window during a rainstorm. The following morning, Mike performs repair work on the faulty windowsill.  The next day, at Schweikart & Cokely, Kim is looking at images of Mesa Verdes cowboy logo when Rich enters her office. Rich suggests to Kim that she temporarily disengage from her work on Mesa Verde. When pressed by Kim, Rich implies that he has seen through her actions and has deduced that she and Jimmy have been working against Mesa Verde on the Acker case. Incensed, Kim follows Rich into the hallway outside and, in front of other staff members, angrily confronts him and denies that she is throwing the Tucumcari situation against her own client. She returns to her office and sulks."

At the nail salon, Jimmy presents Joeys film crew with a project to edit an old Mesa Verde commercial in which a young Kevin and his father appear. Jimmy wants to produce the video for the next day, so the crew tinkers with a green screen and hires a few locals to shoot that night in the salon. Remorseful, Kim goes to the salon and pitches Jimmy a $75,000 deal favoring Everett Acker, offering to supplement from her own pocket any amount that Mesa Verde will agree to pay in order to quickly close the case. A surprised Jimmy tries to dissuade Kim but ends up accepting the decision. At Schweikart and Cokely, Kim, Rich, and Viola attend a conference call with Jimmy and learn that Acker has agreed to settle the case.

After he receives the file, Roberts partner informs him that Lily has called in identifying the car she had seen at the TravelWire, which matches the description of a car which rammed a motorist at a public parking lot on the day of Freds murder. At the parking lot, the motorist states that he can identify the driver of the other car, giving them a lead linking Lalo to the murder. After Jimmy leaves, Kevins legal team struggles to figure out how they can deal with his threats. Kevin excuses himself from the conference room to surreptitiously make a phone call to Jimmy and agree to a deal. Meeting with Kevin in a parking garage, Jimmy lays out his terms: Acker is allowed to keep his house, receives $75,000, and a public apology from Mesa Verde; while the photographer receives $100,000 for future use and credit for the banks logo.

After the wedding, Kim leaves for her office at Schweikart and Cokely, promising to return home early. Jimmy gets a call from Nacho, who tells him that he has a new client named Jorge de Guzman. ""De Guzman"" is actually an alias being used by Lalo, who has been charged with the murder of Fred Whalen. Jimmy tells the judge that Lalo pleads not guilty; however, the judge denies bail to Lalo. Later, as he and Jimmy privately discuss the case, Lalo says that he wants neither a deal with prosecution nor a trial, intending to be released on bail.

Kim, Rich, Paige, and Kevin convene at Mesa Verdes offices to discuss their disastrous last meeting. Kim apologizes profusely for the incident, but Kevin is disappointed with how poorly S&C dealt with the situation. Before Kim and Rich leave, Kevin tells Kim she can ""do better than"" Jimmy. Kim starts to leave with Rich, but changes her mind and returns to the meeting room. She tells Kevin that for all S&Cs slip-ups, Kevin also has some responsibility to bear for the fiasco by ignoring her legal advice - Kevin decided to listen to Jimmy, even when Kim explicitly told him not to.

In Houston, Gus is attending a board meeting of the CEOs of Madrigals restaurant chains, chaired by Peter Schuler. Later that evening, after checking into a local hotel, Gus visits an adjacent room where Schuler and Lydia are waiting for him. Peter complains about the delays in building the excavation and warns that it will be difficult for him to get further funds, considering how close hes come to getting caught. Gus assures him that things will be smoothed out, reminding him of a situation in Santiago where their backs were on the wall but Peter managed to get Gus indebted to him.

Its clear Gus needs to do something, as he cannot risk his insider in Lalos crew being exposed.  Under the cover of darkness, Gus and Nacho break into a Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant in Los Lunas. While Nacho vandalizes the seating area, Gus turns up the burners in the kitchen, filling the room with gas, and heats up a fryer full of oil.
