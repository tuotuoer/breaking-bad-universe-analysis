In the passenger seat, another man is passed out, also wearing a gas mask. In the back of the RV are two bodies. After crashing the RV in a ditch, the drivers climbs out, dons a shirt handing from the side view mirror, and retrieves a video camera and gun from the vehicle. Recording a message on the camera, the man identifies himself as Walter White and bids a cryptic farewell to his wife and son as sirens are heard in the distance. Walt then walks onto the road and awaits the apparent approach of police, gun in hand. Three weeks earlier, on his 50th birthday, Walt wakes up before dawn and exercises while contemplating of a plaque on his wall commemorating his contributions to research that won a Nobel Prize. At breakfast, his pregnant wife, Skyler, hands him a plate of eggs topped by veggie bacon spelling out ""50"". They banter with their handicapped son, Walt Jr., who complains about the veggie bacon. Afterwards, Walt drops off Junior at J. P. Wynne High School, where Walt also works as a chemistry teacher. In class, Walt explains to his apathetic students how he regards chemistry as the study of change as well as matter. After school, Walt performs his second job at a car wash, where he finds himself washing the convertible of a disrespectful student. Returning home, Walt discovers that Skyler has organized a surprise birthday party for him. Among the guests is Walts gregarious brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, a DEA agent. Coincidentally, Hank is the subject of a local news report covering a methamphetamine lab bust. Walt is impressed with the amount of money recovered from the dealers, and Hank discloses that he confiscated $700,000. Hank then invites Walt to accompany him on another bust. Meanwhile, in the living room, Skyler talks to her sister Marie, Hanks wife, about her pregnancy. The following day, Walt steals boxes full of chemistry equipment from his high school, while Jesse arranges to buy a used RV so that will be used as the duos mobile meth lab. Upon driving into the desert, Walt strips down to his underwear (so as not to contaminate his clothes with chemical odors) and cooks his first batch of crystal methamphetamine. Jesse is astonished with the chemical purity of the product Walt has produced. Emilio ties up Jesse, then joins Krazy-8 in watching Walt cook. As Walt prepares the ingredients, Emilio absent-mindedly throws a cigarette out the window, thereby starting a brush fire. Inside, Walt mixes chemicals that produce a deadly vapor before he dashes out of the RV. Krazy-8 and Emilio begin firing bullets through the door of the RV over Walts head, but are eventually overcome by the fumes. Walt unties Jesse, puts a gas mask on him, and props him in the passenger seat before making his attempt to escape in the opening scene."

Walts breakfast with his family is interrupted when Jesse calls his house posing as a telemarketer. When Walt finds privacy, Jesse demands that he out in dealing with Krazy-8 and disposing of Emilios body. Walt tells Jesse that he cant come until after work. After Walt leaves for school, Skyler attempts to trace the call and hears Jesses profane voicemail message, clueing her in to the fact that Walt was not talking to a telemarketer. At the White residence, Skyler conducts a web search for Jesse and comes across one of his social media profiles. Meanwhile, Walt brings the unconscious Krazy-8 back to Jesses house, where they take him into the basement and secure him to a pole with a bicycle lock around his neck. Walt and Jesse then argue about what to do next. Their first priority is to dispose of Emilios body and destroy the evidence. Walt suggests that they do so using hydrofluoric acid to break down the corpse. They also agree that they have to kill Krazy-8. At Jesses house, Walt, reluctant to kill Krazy-8, but ends up serving him a sandwich and providing makeshift toiletries instead. In order to relieve his stress, Walt smokes Jesses marijuana. Jesse returns home and asks Walt how the murder went. Walt promises to take care of Krazy-8 tomorrow, then leaves to meet Skyler at a hospital for her sonogram. There, the couple learn that they are expecting a girl. Afterward, Skyler confronts Walt about his association with Jesse. In an attempt to hide the truth, Walt falsely confesses that Jesse is his pot dealer and asks his wife to ""climb out of my ass"".  Walt struggles to keep his secrets in check at work while Jesse retrieves Emilios body from the RV. As he is dragging the body across the driveway, Skyler appears at his front gate. Jesse quickly positions himself so that she cant see the body. Skyler tells Jesse that her brother-in-law is a DEA agent and warns Jesse to stop selling pot to her husband. After she leaves, Jesse hauls Emilios body up to his second-floor bathroom and, donning a gas mask, tries to dissolve the body in the bathtub with the hydrofluoric acid."
2,1,3,1.08,4,0,"As Walt and Jesse are scrubbing up the dissolved remains of Emilio, the grisly scene takes Walt back to his days as a graduate student. In a flashback, Walt and a female lab partner are analyzing the human bodys chemical composition. After discovering that only 99 percent of the bodys makeup is accounted for chemically, Walt muses that there has to be more to a human being than that. Back in the present, Walt flushes a bloody bucketful down the toilet. At the White residence, Skyler and Junior are painting the new babys room as Marie looks on. Juniors cell phone rings and he departs. Having been told by Walt that he has been smoking marijuana, Skyler tells her sister that shes writing a story with a stoner character and asks her about pot. Marie assumes the question that Junior is a pothead. Skyler insists shes only talking about a fictional character, but Marie isnt buying it.  After regaining consciousness, Walt tells Krazy-8 that he has lung cancer, scoops up the plate shards, and leaves to make another sandwich. Upon returning, he tries to get to know Krazy-8, who tells Walt that doing so wont make killing him any easier. Walt admits that he is looking for a reason to spare Krazy-8. The two seem to bond as Krazy-8 reminisces about being the son of a local furniture-store owner whose commercials air on late-night television. Walt recalls buying a crib for Junior from the same store. When Walt admits to Krazy-8 that he hasnt told his family about the cancer diagnosis, Krazy-8 deduces that Walt is cooking meth so he can leave money for his family. Krazy-8 offers to write Walt a check, then suggests he isnt cut out for murder. When Walt leaves to retrieve the key to the bike lock, Krazy-8 seems relieved. The following morning, Jesse returns home to find Krazy-8 missing from the basement and the bike lock left behind. Meanwhile, the DEA discover Walt and Jesses cook site in the desert. Hank and Gomez quickly put together a theory that a mobile meth lab caught fire and that the occupants sped off after putting out the fire. However, Krazy-8s low-rider car has been left behind. Hank wonders why until he discovers meth hidden behind the stereo."
3,1,4,1.09,7,2,"Hank puts his DEA team on notice that ""new players"" in Albuquerque are producing a super-pure type of methamphetamine. He describes the criminals as possessing a high skill set. The scene then cuts to Walt, standing at his bathroom mirror in his underwear, messily brushing his teeth. Walt, Hank, Skyler, Marie, and Junior have a barbecue at the White residence. Walt reminisces about the first time he met Skyler, which causes her to burst into tears and run inside the house. When Marie asks Walt what is wrong, he tells the rest of the family about his cancer diagnosis. Junior, Hank and Marie are shocked at the news. Skyler blames chemicals from Walts past lab work for the cancer, Marie proposes an oncology treatment plan, and Hank assures Walt that he will take care of his family whatever happens. Skyler makes an appointment for Walt to visit a top-rated oncologist. Walt initially balks at paying a $5,000 deposit on the treatment but eventually relents, saying hell borrow the money from his pension. Instead, he retrieves some drug money he has hidden in a heating duct inside his house. Walt pretends hes checking for mice when Junior interrupts him, confused by Walt acting as if nothing is going on. Alone in his former bedroom, Jesse comes across a chemistry paper from high school that Walt had graded with an ""F"", along with a caricature drawn on the back mocking the teacher. As he sees this, Combo calls and says Jesse has got customers for his new meth product. Jesse heads over to Walts house to tell him the news, but Walt is instead angry that Jesse has come to the house to talk business and accuses Jesse of wearing a wire.  Walt orders him to leave. Before Jesse does, he leaves $4,000 that their customers have paid for the meth. "
4,1,5,0.97,8,0,"Donning a jacket and tie, Jesse interviews for a job at a realty office but bails upon discovering that the job requires him to wear a full-body costume advertising their services. He comes across an old friend, Badger, wearing the costume, and they smoke marijuana together in an alley. Jesse says hes thinking of retiring from the drug business. Badger offers to partner up if he ever gets back in. Walt and Skyler attend a birthday party for Elliott Schwartz, Walts friend from graduate school and his former business partner. Also at the party is Elliotts wife, Gretchen, Walts former lab partner. At the party, Walt views a framed Scientific American cover story about Elliotts company, Gray Matter Technologies, and meets some of Elliotts colleagues. When asked which university he teaches at, Walt hesitates to answer. He and Skyler are embarrassed when their birthday present of ramen pales in comparison to the gifts of the more well-heeled guests. Over breakfast the next morning, Walt and Skyler silently glare at each other. Meanwhile, Jesse shows Badger the RV, and the two head out to the desert to make meth. Badger clowns around while Jesse cooks. However, Jesse is dissatisfied with the poor quality of the meth he cooks. When he returns home, Walt is met by the rest of the family in the living room. Skyler says that she cant understand why Walt is refusing treatment, then makes the other members of the family say their piece as they hold a ""talking pillow"". Hank tries to use sports metaphors to describe Walts cancer while Junior calls his father a ""pussy"" for refusing treatment while hes dealt with cerebral palsy all his life. When Marie and then Hank express support for Walts decision to die on his own terms, Skyler tries to pressure them to take her side. When Walt finally gets the talking pillow, he asks what good is living for just a little longer when chemotherapy would make it impossible for him to live a normal life. Walt sticks to his decision to refuse treatment. The next morning, Walt smells Skylers pillow and skin scream, and observes the baby and cancer books on her nightstand. Walking into the kitchen, Walt informs her that he has changed his mind and will accept the treatment. The couple visit a cancer clinic that day. Later, Walt receives a call from Gretchen urging him to accept her and Elliotts money for his cancer treatment. Walt says he appreciates the offer, but falsely claims that his insurance will pay for everything. Walt comes to Jesses house and asks him if he wants to cook."
5,1,6,1.07,8,0,"As he surveys the RV, Walt gives Jesse a stern lecture on how they will conduct business from now on: Walt is to be the ""silent partner"" who handles the chemistry side of the operation while Jesse deals on the street. Walt further stresses that he wants ""no more bloodshed."" This scene is intercut with shots of a bald man calmly walking through a group of bikers on a street littered with smoldering debris. As we pan up and his face is revealed, the bald man is revealed to be Walt in a flashforward. Walt receives treatment at the cancer clinic, convincing Skyler to leave him. Before departing, Skyler expresses concern that the check promised to them by Elliott has not been received. Walt falsely claims that he has deposited Elliotts check, but later asks the clinics clerk not to deposit his own check until Monday. At the Crystal Palace and around the city, Jesse sells the new meth batch to eager buyers. The next day, he gives Walt a pre-paid cell phone. Walt is dissatisfied with the $1,300 generated by the batch, but Jesse replies that it isnt easy selling meth ""one teenth at a time."" Wanting to move their product in bulk, Walt asks if Jesse knows any distributors. Jesse alludes to Krazy-8 being his distributor until Walt killed him. Jesse later tells Walt a ""badass"" named Tuco Salamanca has taken over Krazy-8s territory. Walt demands to meet Tuco, but Jesse insists that they stick with the less-risky approach of selling small quantities of meth. At the high school, Hugo is arrested by the DEA. Over a poker game in Walts living room, Hank explains that Hugo fit the profile for the lab thefts and that marijuana was found in his vehicle, the latter of which will cost him his job and land him in jail. Walt bets all his chips, causing Hank to fold. Hank looks shocked when Marie shows him Walt had a handful of nothing. As he takes a shower the next morning, Walts hair falls out in clumps as a result of the chemotherapy. After calling Jesse, he finds out from Skinny Pete that Jesse has ended up in the hospital. There, Walt observes a sleeping Jesse wearing a neck brace and asks Skinny Pete to tell him about Tuco. The next morning, upon finding more clumps of hair falling out, Walt shaves his head completely. Carrying a bag of what appears to be crystal meth, Walt talks his way into Tucos hideout. Upon meeting Tuco, Walt identifies himself as ""Heisenberg"" and demands $50,000. When Tuco and his gang balk at the demand, Walt picks up the crystalline nugget he brought with him and hurls it to the floor. The ensuing explosion blows out the windows in Tucos office, sending debris fallling onto the street below."
6,1,7,1.5,6,0,"At the high school, Walt and Skyler attend a PTA meeting concerning the chemistry lab thefts. Seated next to each other, Walt begins to stroke Skylers thigh under the table. She resists at first but then revels in the erotic moment, which is cut short when Walt is called upon. Later in the parking lot, the two have sex in Walts car. Skyler wonders why this tryst felt especially good, to which Walt replies because it was illegal. While a realtor shows Jesses house to a couple, Walt arrives and looks for Jesse. Walt finds him in the RV, his ribs still bandaged from his run-in with Tuco. Walt hands Jesse his cut from the deal with Tuco, but Jesse is unhappy to learn that the deal requites them to make two more pounds of meth. Jesse mocks Walts ""brilliant business plan,"" saying that its almost impossible to procure enough pseudo to produce that much meth. Back at his house, Jesse frets that itll take ""two, three hundred boxes of sinus pills"" to make four pounds of meth. Walt says theyll produce their own ingredients, but when he hands Jesse a list of chemicals and equipment to buy, Jesse tries to back out. It is after Walt encourages him to believe in himself that Jesse agrees to take on the endeavor. In Jesses kitchen, Walt extracts the aluminum powder from Etch-a-Sketch toys, and mixes it with powdered iron oxide to make thermite, which produces a surface temperature high enough to melt through four inches of solid steel, and thus will break any lock that the warehouse is likely to have on its door. That evening, after locking a guard inside a portable toilet, Walt and Jesse break into the warehouse and, despite a few glitches, pull off the heist and steal a drum of methylamine. Unfortunately, the RV fails to start the next day, forcing the duo to cook in Jesses basement. Even more unfortunate, the realtor has scheduled another open house. Walt tells Jesse to get the visitors to leave while he tries to cook. When one of the buyers insists on inspecting the basement, Jesse pushes him back into the kitchen and announces the house is not for sale anymore."
7,2,1,1.66,3,0,"The episode opens on black and white shots of a backyard. The camera pans over to reveal what appears to be a plastic eyeball in a pool of water. The eyeball is then sucked into the drain of the pool while a pink teddy bear, missing its left eye, floats underwater. After buying meth from Walt and Jesse at the junkyard, Tuco violently attacks his henchman, No-Doze, for presuming to speak for him. Afterwards, he drives away, leaving Walt and Jesse to ponder the danger of their situation. In Jesses car, Walt calculates that he needs $737,000 to provide for his family’s future, factoring in medical bills, his childrens tuition, mortgage, and other variables -- in other words, eleven more meth deals -- before he can leave the drug business.  Skyler notices that Walt has spent the night watching the street outside; he bolts upright when the phone rings. The call is from Marie, but Skyler picks up the receiver and immediately hangs up. Later, Walt confronts Jesse about the other night, and questions him on whether he had given information to Tuco about him. Jesse denies doing so and warns Walt that Tuco about to make a move. Jesse wants Walt to get his own gun to double their chances of survival, but Walt has another idea: use castor beans to create ricin, a poison they can slip to Tuco. Walt grabs Jesses gun to protect his family. Jesse protests, saying he needs it, but Walt orders him to leave town. Jesse grabs a duffel bag full of money and flees, while Walt speeds home. There, he calls out for his family members but gets no response. He draws the gun and begins to search the house. Walt soon finds Skyler relaxing in the tub; she has had the whole house to herself as Junior is visiting his friend Louis for dinner. Skyler asks Walt where he has been, but instead of answering her, he goes to stash his drug money and Jesses gun in a box of diapers."

Spent casings and drops of blood litter the ground. A body lies behind the car, half hidden from view.  Tuco takes Walt and Jesse to a remote, run-down shack in the desert where his ailing uncle, referred to as Tio, lives. Tuco orders Walt and Jesse to empty their pockets. Among Walts belongings is the ricin-laced meth and his wallet, which reveals his true identity to Tuco.  After the meal, Tio continues to ring his bell until Tuco realizes that his uncle is trying to warn him about Walt and Jesse. Tuco becomes enraged and drags Jesse outside, holding a gun to his head. Tuco forces Walt to admit that he tried to poison him, but Walt then states that Tuco is an ""insane, degenerate piece of filth"" who deserves to die. Tuco, further enraged by Walts remark, takes his eyes off Jesse, allowing him to grab a rock and strike Tuco across the head. During the ensuing struggle, Walt grabs Tucos assault rifle and Jesse his pistol, shooting Tuco in his side. They kick him into a ditch and leave him to die."

Hank brings in Tio -- real name Hector Salamanca -- hoping to get him to identify Jesse. Despite being seemingly invalid, Hector does indeed remember Jesse, but follows what Gomez calls an ""old school gangbang Mexican"" code by refusing to rat on him. After Hank asks for Hectors help, he replies by defecating in his wheelchair. The DEA is forced to release Jesse without charge. Upon being released, Jesse calls his father for a lift, but his father refuses to help him. Jesse then calls Walt at the hospital and they bring one another up to speed.

The line of random objects ends with a pair of eyeglasses which appear to belong to Walt.   The next morning, Skyler leaves the house again without word. Walt suggests that he and Junior do something ""fun,"" and takes him for a driving lesson in the Aztek. However, the lesson ends abruptly when Walt wont let Junior use both feet to work the pedals, a technique to compensate for his disability, and he loses control of the car. "

Following a chemotherapy session, Dr. Delcavoli advises that Walt be cautiously optimistic about his chances. However, Walts optimism quickly fades when he sees the final bill for the treatment.  Setting out pretzels and soda in his new apartment, Jesse presents a business opportunity to Skinny Pete, Badger, and Combo. Hell front them each an ounce of meth at a time, and they in turn sell the product for $2,500, $2,000 of which goes to Jesse. Discussing the meth theft with Walt, Jesse argues that they need to accept a little ""breakage"" as the cost of doing business. Meanwhile, back at the White residence, Walt shows Skyler the crumpled cigarette package he retrieved from the toilet, and accusingly asks if she knows anything about it.

Shortly afterward, it arrives at a vacuum shop. The extractor, a man named Ed, drives the van into the shop and we see that instead of Walter White, Ed tells Saul Goodman to get out. Saul is amused to learn that Eds cover story about being a vacuum cleaner repairman is real. Ed takes a photo of Saul and starts working on Sauls new Nebraska ID. He says that Saul will have to wait at least two days to be extracted out of the state, since his face is well known in Albuquerque, and that in the meantime Saul will be staying in a downstairs bunker with another person awaiting extraction. Knowing the person is Walter White, Saul asks Ed how Walt is doing. Ed shows him a monitor screen with live footage of an impatient Walt angrily pacing around the bunker and slapping a ceiling lamp."
61,5,16,10.28,8,0,"With police searching for him in New Hampshire, Walter White finds an unlocked car, its windows covered in snow, and gets inside. Suffering from the cold weather, he searches for something to start the engine. In the glove compartment, he finds a Marty Robbins music tape and a screwdriver. He tries to use the screwdriver to start the car, but fails after several attempts. The flickering lights of a police car appear, though Walt cant be seen from outside because of the icy snow covering all the windows. As a flashlight passes over the car, Walt quietly pleads, ""Just get me home. Ill do the rest."" The police car leaves without further inspection, and after a moment of intuition, the car keys drop from the visor into his lap. He starts the car, knocks the snow off the windows, and begins his drive back to Albuquerque."
