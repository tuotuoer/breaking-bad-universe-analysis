      "In the desert outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a man wearing nothing but his underwear and a gas mask erratically drives an RV down a desolate highway. In the passenger seat, another man is passed out, also wearing a gas mask. In the back of the RV are two bodies. After crashing the RV in a ditch, the drivers climbs out, dons a shirt handing from the side view mirror, and retrieves a video camera and gun from the vehicle. Recording a message on the camera, the man identifies himself as Walter White and bids a cryptic farewell to his wife and son as sirens are heard in the distance. Walt then walks onto the road and awaits the apparent approach of police, gun in hand. Three weeks earlier, on his 50th birthday, Walt wakes up before dawn and exercises while contemplating of a plaque on his wall commemorating his contributions to research that won a Nobel Prize. At breakfast, his pregnant wife, Skyler, hands him a plate of eggs topped by veggie bacon spelling out \"50\". They banter with their handicapped son, Walt Jr., who complains about the veggie bacon. Afterwards, Walt drops off Junior at J. P. Wynne High School, where Walt also works as a chemistry teacher. In class, Walt explains to his apathetic students how he regards chemistry as the study of change as well as matter. After school, Walt performs his second job at a car wash, where he finds himself washing the convertible of a disrespectful student. Returning home, Walt discovers that Skyler has organized a surprise birthday party for him. Among the guests is Walts gregarious brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, a DEA agent. Coincidentally, Hank is the subject of a local news report covering a methamphetamine lab bust. Walt is impressed with the amount of money recovered from the dealers, and Hank discloses that he confiscated $700,000. Hank then invites Walt to accompany him on another bust. Meanwhile, in the living room, Skyler talks to her sister Marie, Hanks wife, about her pregnancy. The following day, Walt steals boxes full of chemistry equipment from his high school, while Jesse arranges to buy a used RV so that will be used as the duos mobile meth lab. Upon driving into the desert, Walt strips down to his underwear (so as not to contaminate his clothes with chemical odors) and cooks his first batch of crystal methamphetamine. Jesse is astonished with the chemical purity of the product Walt has produced. Emilio ties up Jesse, then joins Krazy-8 in watching Walt cook. As Walt prepares the ingredients, Emilio absent-mindedly throws a cigarette out the window, thereby starting a brush fire. Inside, Walt mixes chemicals that produce a deadly vapor before he dashes out of the RV. Krazy-8 and Emilio begin firing bullets through the door of the RV over Walts head, but are eventually overcome by the fumes. Walt unties Jesse, puts a gas mask on him, and props him in the passenger seat before making his attempt to escape in the opening scene.\n"
